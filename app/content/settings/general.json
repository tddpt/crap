  "welcomeText": "# Yo, Welcome to PILE OF CRAP PRODUCTIONS - The Blog About A Walking Pile of Adidas Crap\n\nI﻿ know nothing about music theory, but I've been producing computer music with [Reason](https://reasonstudios.com/) for over 20 years nonetheless. My, how this software has grown. However, I was not growing as a musician. The DAW controlled my ass when it's supposed to be the other way around. It's time to move on.\\\n\\\nI﻿'ve acquired and polychained a [RD-6](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0EDY) drum machine (a TR-606 clone), and a [TD-3](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0ECM) bass synth (a TB-303 clone). Wonderful and cheap devices. Perfect for the organic bare-bones sound I'm after.\n\nThe lyrics are tasteless and simple. It's monophonic and monotonous. It's acidic and asinine. My girlfriend refuses to listen to my music because production is loud and repetitive. \n\nI﻿ rumble anyway. I look good doing it.",
